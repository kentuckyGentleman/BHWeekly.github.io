				At the forefront of Beverly Hills media and politics for close to 20 years, Publisher &amp; CEO Josh Gross launched Beverly Hills Weekly in 1999.  The newspaper covers the <a class="textLink" href="http://www.beverlyhills.org/" target="_blank">City of Beverly Hills</a>, the <a class="textLink" href="http://www.bhusd.org/" target="_blank">Beverly Hills Unified School District</a>, and the surrounding communities of Beverlywood and Los Angeles.  Beverly Hills Weekly is adjudicated as a newspaper of general circulation for the City of Beverly Hills and the County of Los Angeles.
				<br><br>
				A Beverly Hills native, Josh is a graduate of <a class="textLink" href="http://bv.bhusd.org/" target="_blank">Beverly Vista School</a>, <a class="textLink" href="http://bhhs.bhusd.org/" target="_blank">Beverly Hills High School</a>, <a class="textLink" href="http://www.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA</a> (B.A., History), and <a class="textLink" href="http://www.lls.edu/" target="_blank">Loyola Law School</a> (J.D.)  As an attorney, he is admitted to the bar in Washington DC, the US Tax Court, and the US Supreme Court.
				<br><br>
				Josh is frequently in demand as a television and radio commentator, focusing on the subjects of local and state politics, campaigns, entertainment, public education, real estate, and all things Beverly Hills.  Past appearances include media outlets such as <a class="textLink" href="http://www.cnn.com/" target="_blank">CNN</a>, KIRN, WUST, <a class="textLink" href="https://www.usatoday.com/" target="_blank">USA Today</a>, and many others.
				<br><br>
				Josh comes from a well-known broadcasting and print media family.  Josh’s late grandfather Jack O. Gross founded <a class="textLink" href="http://www.cbs8.com/" target="_blank">KFMB</a> Channel 8, the first television station in San Diego, in 1949.  Josh’s late uncle Laurence Gross served for many years as the entertainment critic on <a class="textLink" href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/" target="_blank">KNSD</a>, the NBC television affiliate in San Diego.
				<br><br>
				A strong supporter of public schools, in 2006 Josh was elected president of the Beverly Hills High School Alumni Association, which represents over 20,000 Beverly High graduates living around the world.
