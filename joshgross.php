				A Beverly Hills native, Josh is a graduate of Beverly Vista School, Beverly Hills High School, UCLA (B.A., History), and Loyola Law School (J.D.)  As an attorney, he is admitted to the bar in Washington DC, the US Tax Court, and the US Supreme Court.

				Josh is frequently in demand as a television and radio commentator, focusing on the subjects of local and state politics, campaigns, entertainment, public education, real estate, and all things Beverly Hills.  Past appearances include media outlets such as CNN, KIRN, WUST, USA Today, and many others.

				Josh comes from a well-known broadcasting and print media family.  Josh’s late grandfather Jack O. Gross founded KFMB Channel 8, the first television station in San Diego, in 1949.
